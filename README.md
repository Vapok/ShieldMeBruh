# _Shield Me Bruh!_ by Vapok

This is a lightweight Quality of Life module for auto-equipping a shield when a one-handed weapon is equipped.

To set the desired shield, open the Player Inventory and **middle-click** the desired shield to auto-equip.  Press the **middle-mouse** button again to _deselect_ the shield.

This will place the _Shield Me Bruh!_ icon on the shield to let you know that it's the shield configured.  The shield will remain selected, even after log out, unless you deselect it.

From there, simply equip a one-handed weapon. Need a shield?  _Shield Me Bruh!_ will take care of it!
